SI 506 - FINAL PROJECT PLAN

* What's your overall project plan, in 1-3 sentences?
-----
For my final project, i will get the information from both Facebook New York Time Group API and New York Time API. And i will try to
find out the most liked post on Facebook and most hit article on NYT. In general, i will try to find out the connection between these two,
to see if they are under same topic or not.

* Why are you choosing to do this project?
-----
Since after the president election recently, i am pretty sure that Trump and Hilary are still the hot topic right now. I just want to figure
out this true or not.

* What classes are you planning to define? For each:
- What will the class be called?
- What will one instance of the class represent? How would you describe it in English?
- What will the class constructor require as input?
- What are three instance variables the class might have?
- What are a couple methods the class might have? What will they do?

-----
class Post:
    def __init__(self, params, access_token): #this one defines the constructors as input.
        self.name
        self.likes
        self.message
    def accumulate(self): #this use to count how many likes for each post.
        n = 0
        for x in self.message:
            for i in likes:
                n += 1
        return n
    def __str__(self): #this gives the format to show the data i collect from the API.
        return "This post's name is {}, and its message is {}.".format(self.name, self.message)

class Post_1:
    def __init__(self, params_1, access_token_1):#this one defines the constructors as input.
        self.name
        self.likes
        self.message
    def accumulate(self): #this use to count how many hits for each post.
        n = 0
        for x in self.message:
            for i in likes:
                n += 1
        return n
    def __str__(self): #this gives the format to show the data i collect from the API.
        return "This artcle's name is {}, and its article message is {}.".format(self.name, self.message)


* If you plan to define functions outside class definitions, what are they? What will they take as input? What will they return?
-----
I will define a function out of the class definitions about the words in the name of the post and articles as the top hit article and
most liked post. Another may need write a function of sorting, and figure out the top hit article and most liked post with the id.
def top_likers(dic):
    return sorted(dic, key = lambda x: x[1]], reverse = True)
def caching():
    url_params = {}
    url_params['limit'] = 200
    url_params["access_token"] = access_token
    url_params["fields"] = "message, likes, name"
    r = requests.get(baseurl ,params=url_params)
    fb_data = json.loads(r.text)
    return f = json.dumps(fb_data, sort_keys=True, indent=2)

* What sequence of data might you be sorting? (A list of posts? Of photos? Of... ????) By what attribute will you sort that sequence? Why?
-----
I will use the reverse sorting to find the top liked posts and top hit article. It is a list of likes and list of hits. I will use the len of the likes list to sort the sequence
for the Facebook, and use the sorting the hits attribute for the NYT. This can be the best way to figure out which is the most liked post and top hits articles.


* What APIs are you planning to use? Provide links to the documentation here.
What kind of authentication does each one require? OAuth? A key? Do you have to register an account? What parameters do you need to include in your parameters dictionary?
-----
I used the New York Time API https://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json#/Console/GET/articlesearch.json and the Facebook https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer?method=GET&path=5281959998%2Fposts&version=v2.3.
Both of them use the key, access_token for Facebook and API key for NYT. And i didn't register accounts for them. I use the begin_date and end_date as parameters.


* What might you need to write tests for in this project?
-----
To check the articles and post are located in the 20160601 -- 20101201 period.
Write the test about the top 5 hits article and five most like posts are in the list, and the length is 5.


* What major concerns do you have about this project plan, if any?
-----
One major concern is the limitation of the data i collected since i want to find the posts and the articles from 20160601 to 20161201. But more data means
more pressure to my laptop, i don't know if i can run this properly.


* Write some code to get data from each API and save that data in a file (cache it). Submit that code file and the data file(s) you save. Here: What do we need to know to run the code you submit? What does it do? What data have you submitted? Please describe briefly.
-----
In my code, i use the variable r and r_1 to get the data from the Facebook NewYorkTime page and the New York Time official website. And use the f and f_1 to cache it to the
"cached_results_facebook.txt" and "cached_results_NYT.txt". On the data it shows the recent post and article on both page with the name, message, likes and hits. Then i will do the
sort the post and article list by likes and hits.
